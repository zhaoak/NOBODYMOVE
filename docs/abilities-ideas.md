# Abilities ideas

we're currently kicking around the idea of having players be able to pick active and passive abilities;
kind of like the noita perk system or the upgrade mutations in nuclear throne

probably allow players to have one active ability w/dedicated button for it and some passive benefit abilities,
maybe two or three

## active ability ideas

- web shooting: create webs that act like background terrain you can walk on
- web grapple: shoot a web that acts like a grapplehook and swing around with it
    - should only pull you towards grapplepoint a small amount: intended to be used with existing momentum
- on hold button, aim firegroup 2 separately from 1 using movement inputs but lose ability to do movement inputs
    - works better with twin stick controller obvs

## passive ability ideas

- jumping spooder: makes your jump significantly (like 3x) more powerful, greatly expanding mobility; also makes eyes big and cute
- ambush predator: after not moving or shooting for 0.5s, damage for your next shot scales up to 300% over the next three seconds
