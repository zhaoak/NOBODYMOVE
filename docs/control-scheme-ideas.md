# Control scheme ideas

Given that we're making a game where you can wield up to eight guns at once, and the average human only has ten fingers, eight direct trigger inputs are not likely to be feasible for the vast majority of people.

Here's some ideas on how to handle that.

## eight separate trigger inputs

#### Pros

    - most fine-grained control scheme

#### Cons

    - almost nobody has that many inputs available except on MMO mice
    - will hurt jerma's brain
    - hard to remember which gun is which
    - extended play will probably cause carpal tunnel

## player-defined firegroups

- Players can select any number of their guns to fire when they push a particular trigger button
- Would reduce number of necessary trigger inputs to 4 or 2 at minimum

#### Pros
    - still quite fine-grained control
    - ultimate determination of behavior up to player
    - allows player to have different firegroups for guns with different utility, e.g. mobility firegroup, spam firegroup, etc
    - can flexibly handle various input devices with different numbers of buttons available to use as triggers

#### Cons
    - slightly increased control complexity
    - player would need to stop what they're doing ingame to tweak firegroups, such as when they pick up/swap out guns

## One trigger input

- clicky button and then All Gun shoot All Time

#### Pros
    - Most simple
    - Kind of funny
    - Comedy amounts of projectile spam
    - Zero brainpower required

#### Cons
    - No ability to not shoot specific guns
    - Severly hampers utility of specific guns for mobility vs damage vs area denial, etc
    - Severly hampers interesting and varied gun design
