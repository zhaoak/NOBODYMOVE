# rankedish list of traits and features we want to prioritize for spoodergame

## high want

- platformer bullet hell roguelike
    - you pick up weapons and gear as you go along and lose it all and have to start over on death

- weapons and equipables that allow unconventional movement strategies

- player movement mechanics that allow you to preserve and redirect existing momentum to move much faster than the default walking speed

- make you feel like you are exploiting and breaking with your build/item choices them when you are playing them as intended

- require twitchy reflex-testing responses to incoming threats

- build/equipment customization to the degree that you're basically programming without touching the game's code

- builds/equipables can have strongly defined strengths and weaknesses, like absolutely absurd area denial vs absurd single-target burst damage

- communicate complex mechanics well and support the player without making them feel like they *have* to read the wiki

- weapons that are very powerful at killing enemies and equally powerful at letting you kill yourself with them

## mid want

- spidergrind
    - sandbox mode where you can make any build and see how far it gets you

- weapons and abilities that feel *punchy* and *impactful* because of sound and visual effects
    - nice to have, not a priority while working out gamefeel

- ragdoll explosion launch comedy

- variance in enemy design that reflect different types of possible builds the player could use

- equipables with utility that are very _mechanically distinct_ and that must be used in very different ways to maximize their effectiveness

- weapons that require really stupid gimmick behavior/strategies in exchange for great utility in one specific area/niche
    - especially good if they require the player to alter their playstyle to use them effectively

- weapons that are big, unwieldy, and go bonk really hard

- classes/characters that have unique active abilities that encourage/are beneficial for different playstyles/builds

- high degree of vertical mobility, quick jumping/flying/launching self etc

## less want but still want

- your health pool is not actually all that large compared to the damage enemies can do (basically you die in relatively few hits, so avoiding damage matters)

- you should *always be moving*

- weapons that require really stupid gimmick behavior/strategies in exchange for great utility in one specific area/niche

- multiplayer
    - would be incredibly fun but also possibly very time consuming in terms of dev time/resources

## no want (things to avoid)

- big damage number go brrrrrrr, specifically when it's from a build choice _you_ made
  - avoid relying on the number go big, have a visual/tactile approach
