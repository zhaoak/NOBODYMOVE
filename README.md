# NOBODY MOVE

Prototype for a Love2D platformer/shooter game about heavily armed (and legged) spiders, written in Lua

## How to run

First, you'll need to install the Love2D game engine. See the [Love2D wiki page on getting started](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started) for more details.

Once Love2D is installed, clone this repository to a location of your choice.

Running the game will require different steps based on which operating system you're on--the "getting started" page linked above has detailed instructions.
